# Headless
### How it works
Each player has 4 lives.
Everytime a player dies a heart is dropped on the floor.
If a player dies 4 times they are banned from the server.
The only way to revive a player is to have all 4 of their heads in your inventory.

### Commands
- /revive - Revives a dead player

### Extra
- Credits: me , I literally did everything :3 uwu
- Time taken 5 hours ish
- Reason: I wanted to prove that the dev is one of the servers im in sucks ass, I managed it ^^
